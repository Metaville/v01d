Project Name: Metaville: V.01.D  
Platform: Telegram Mini-App (TON Blockchain)  
Genre: Sci-Fi Survival & Strategy with Web3 Economy  


 üî• Unique Selling Proposition (USP)  
> "The first Telegram strategy where players collectively govern a post-apocalyptic world through DAO, using tokenized oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) as survival currency."  

üåç Key Strengths  
1. Seamless TON/Telegram Integration:  
   - Zero Entry Barriers: Playable inside Telegram (900M+ users) with no installation.  
   - TON Blockchain: NFTs (land, heroes, drones) and tokens (O‚ÇÇ, MVC) on a fast, low-cost infrastructure.  
   - Viral Mechanics: Referral rewards (O‚ÇÇ bonuses for invites).  

2. Deep Lore with Social Resonance:  
   - Post-Collapse World: Flooded Earth, toxic wastelands, and the mega-platform V-01-d.  
   - Oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) as Economic Core: Scarcity-driven resource burned during surface operations. NFT land generates O‚ÇÇ but requires pollution cleanup.  

3. Web3-Native Gameplay Mechanics:  
   - NFT-Driven:  
     - Land: Resource access, home base.  
     - Heroes/Drones: Unique traits (scanners, armor, cargo capacity).  
     - Pets: Efficiency boosters.  
   - Multi-Layered Resource Loop:
   -  Scan ‚Üí Scout ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Transport ‚Üí Sell/DAO  
     
     - Risks: Raiders (PvP/PvE), catastrophes (radiation, acid rain).  
     - O‚ÇÇ as Fuel: Consumed for every action in toxic zones.  

4. DAO World Governance (Governance 2.0):  
   - Vote-Driven Universe Expansion:  
     - Build new platforms (deflationary land mechanics).  
     - Choose expansion paths: Earth, cloud cities, or space.  
     - Fund megaprojects (spaceports, lunar colonies).  
   - Social Experiment: Player decisions reshape the game world (new zones = parachains).  

5. Token Economy with Viral Loops:  
   - Tokenization:  
     - Utility Token O‚ÇÇ: Scarce, burned during gameplay (deflationary).  
     - Governance Token: DAO voting rights.  
     - MVC (MetaVille Credits): In-game currency (resource sales, repairs).  
   - Monetization:  
     - NFT sales (land, heroes, exclusive drones).  
     - Marketplace fees (resources, equipment).  
     - O‚ÇÇ/MVC purchases via TON.
